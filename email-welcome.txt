Instructions for adding the image in MailerLite:
- Host `cropped-logo.png` at an absolute URL (GitHub Pages, your web host, or a CDN). Example path after publishing: `https://<your-domain>/assets/cropped-logo.png`.
- In the MailerLite campaign or automation editor, choose the HTML block and paste the HTML above (or use the drag-and-drop Image block and paste the hosted URL).
- Test by sending to a Gmail address and confirm the logo shows (if Gmail still hides images, click "Display images" for that sender or ensure the sender is a verified domain).
